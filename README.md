# Learn Python in X minutes

Within the `learnpython.py` file you'll find general knowledge and some useful tips about Python 3. It is wonderful as a cheatsheet and I use it all the time by searching the keyword I need help with.

Most of the stuff you'd learn from online courses is featured, and it covers both the fundamentals as well as some advanced elements of the language. Enjoy!!

It's already heavily edited by the time I'm writing this (2020-08-03) so expect a high divergence by the time I'm done. Also, feel free to contribute and make pull requests! Valuable info and contributions are always welcome :)

## Other good resources to learn:
### Docs/Questions
* https://stackoverflow.com/ - If you have ANY questions, they **will** be here.
* https://www.programiz.com/python-programming - THE WEBSITE for documentation. Better than the original Python docs more often than not, though maybe not as complete
### Videos/Courses
* https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTskrapNbzXhwoFUiLCjGgY7  - A great playlist from a great content creator. If you want to learn the ins and outs of Python, he's your guy
* https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9idu6GZ8EU_5B6WpKTdYZbK - An alternative to the playlist above. Really good teacher too
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc - A 6-Hour full course, with timestamps, if you prefer this format. Includes a couple examples, a ML-oriented one and a web-oriented one
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw - Same as above, but 4 hours, with more generic examples
