## 0. Useful stuff about Python
####################################################
# Pyhton Enhancement Proposals, or PEPs, are useful conventions which guide
# the user in writing readable and pretty code, as well as many other
# details about Python. PEP-8 is the Style Guide (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

# According to PEP-8, line length should be limited to 79 characters

# No brackets are used for code blocks. Instead, indentation is used
# The general consensus is to use 4 spaces, but it is not necessary
# What is necessary is to NOT mix tabs and spaces. Python will complain
# NOTE: You can still press the "Tab" key, but make sure your IDE is set
# up so that it will type 4 spaces per press.

# snake_case is the norm, as opposed to camelCase as is standard in other
# languages

# Single line comments start with a hash symbol.

""" Multiline strings can be written
    using three "s, and are often used
    as documentation (docstrings).
"""

type(a_variable)    # Used to find out the type of a variable
help(an_object) # Used to print documentation about a class or function (the
                # ones written in the triple double-quotes)
dir(an_object)  # Used to find all the variable and function names of
                # an object or module
            
# Special Python variables will be surrounded by double underscores.
# A particularly useful one is __name__, which lets the module know 
# if it is the one being executed as the main program, in which case that
# module's __name__ = "__main__", otherwise it will be its own filename.
# https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/__name__-special-variable-python/

# EVERYTHING in Python is an object

# Python has a print function. We'll look at functions later, for now:
print("I'm Python. Nice to meet you!")  # => I'm Python. Nice to meet you!

# By default the print function also prints out a newline at the end.
# Use the optional argument end to change the end string.
print("Hello, World", end="!")  # => Hello, World!

# Simple way to get user input data from console
input_string_var = input("Enter some data: ") # Returns the data as a string
# Note: In earlier versions of Python, input() method was named as raw_input()

## 1. Primitive Datatypes and Operators
####################################################

# Math is what you would expect
1 + 1   # => 2
8 - 1   # => 7
10 * 2  # => 20
35 / 5  # => 7.0

# Integer division rounds down for both positive and negative numbers.
5 // 3       # => 1
-5 // 3      # => -2
5.0 // 3.0   # => 1.0 # works on floats too
-5.0 // 3.0  # => -2.0

# The result of division is always a float
10.0 / 3  # => 3.3333333333333335

# Modulo operation
7 % 3  # => 1

# Exponentiation (x**y, x to the yth power)
2**3  # => 8

# Enforce precedence with parentheses
1 + 3 * 2  # => 7
(1 + 3) * 2  # => 8

# Round numbers manually with round()
round(5.5) # => 6
round(5.758, 2) # => 5.76

# Work in other bases (binary, octal and hexadecimal)
0b10 # => 2
0o10 # => 8
0x10 # => 16

# Scientific notation is also accepted
2.99e8
1.65e-30

# Using underscores, you can make large numbers more legible
10000000 == 10_000_000 # => True

# Boolean values are primitives (Note: the capitalization)
True  # => True
False  # => False

# negate with not
not True   # => False
not False  # => True

# Boolean Operators
# Note "and" and "or" are case-sensitive
True and False  # => False
False or True   # => True

# True and False are actually 1 and 0 but with different keywords
True + True  # => 2
True * 8    # => 8
False - 5   # => -5

# Comparison operators look at the numerical value of True and False
0 == False  # => True
1 == True   # => True
2 == True   # => False
-5 != False  # => True

# Using boolean logical operators on ints casts them to booleans for evaluation, but their non-cast value is returned
# Don't mix up with bool(ints) and bitwise and/or (&,|)
bool(0)     # => False
bool(0.0)   # => False
bool(4)     # => True
bool(-6)    # => True
0 and 2     # => 0
-5 or 0     # => -5

# Equality is ==
1 == 1  # => True
2 == 1  # => False

# Inequality is !=
1 != 1  # => False
2 != 1  # => True

# More comparisons
1 < 10  # => True
1 > 10  # => False
2 <= 2  # => True
2 >= 2  # => True

# Seeing whether a value is in a range
1 < 2 and 2 < 3  # => True
2 < 3 and 3 < 2  # => False
# Chaining makes this look nicer
1 < 2 < 3  # => True
2 < 3 < 2  # => False

# (is vs. ==) is checks if two variables refer to the same object, but == checks
# if the objects pointed to have the same values.
a = [1, 2, 3, 4]  # Point a at a new list, [1, 2, 3, 4]
b = a             # Point b at what a is pointing to
b is a            # => True, a and b refer to the same object
b == a            # => True, a's and b's objects are equal
b = [1, 2, 3, 4]  # Point b at a new list, [1, 2, 3, 4]
b is a            # => False, a and b do not refer to the same object
b == a            # => True, a's and b's objects are equal

# Strings are created with " or '. There is no 'char' type unlike in other languages
"This is a string."
'This is also a string.'

# Strings can be added too! But try not to do this.
"Hello " + "world!"  # => "Hello world!"
# String literals (but not variables) can be concatenated without using '+'
"Hello " "world!"    # => "Hello world!"

# A string can be treated like a list of characters
"Hello world!"[0]  # => 'H'

# You can find the length of a string
len("This is a string")  # => 16

# You can split strings based on a delimiter, by default, space
"This string".split()

# You can also format using f-strings or formatted string literals (in Python 3.6+)
name = "Reiko"
f"She said her name is {name}." # => "She said her name is Reiko"
# You can basically put any Python statement inside the braces and it will be output in the string.
f"{name} is {len(name)} characters long." # => "Reiko is 5 characters long."
number = 250_000_000
f"{number:,}" # => 100,000,000

# And raw strings too
path = r"C:\Users\Documents" # => Prints it as is

# Bytes are a thing, usually used when working with raw binary data
data = b"some binaty data"
# Python allows encoding and decoding of said data into strings and viceversa
string_1 = "Hey, thís is ä string with Ùnicode charactêrs"
bytes_1 = string_1.encode("utf-8") # => b'Hey, th\xc3\xads is \xc3\xa4 string with \xc3\x99nicode charact\xc3\xaars'
bytes_1.decode("utf-8") # => Hey, thís is ä string with Ùnicode charactêrs


# 'None' is an object too
None  # => None

# Don't use the equality "==" symbol to compare objects to None
# Use "is" instead. This checks for equality of object identity.
"etc" is None  # => False
None is None   # => True

# None, 0, and empty strings/lists/dicts/tuples all evaluate to False.
# All other values are True
bool(0)   # => False
bool("")  # => False
bool("False")   # => True
bool([])  # => False
bool({})  # => False
bool(())  # => False

# Casting is available through constructors
int(-2.5) # => -2
int("340")
float(2)
float("2467")
str(450)

# And you can even get infinity
float("inf")
float("-inf")

####################################################
## 2. Variables and Collections
####################################################

# There are no declarations, only assignments. A new object is created
# on every assignment, but x = 300, x = 5, x = 300 will have created 2
# separate int objects. Technically, variables in Python are actually
# references to objects
some_var = 5
some_var  # => 5

# Accessing a previously unassigned variable is an exception.
# See Control Flow to learn more about exception handling.
some_unknown_var  # Raises a NameError

# if can be used as an expression
# Equivalent of C's '?:' ternary operator
"yahoo!" if 3 > 2 else 2  # => "yahoo!"
# Un-pythonic alternative, usually best to avoid it
(value_if_false, value_if_true)[test]

# Lists store sequences
li = []
# You can start with a prefilled list
other_li = [4, 5, 6]

# Add stuff to the end of a list with extend
li.extend("a", "b")  # li is now ["a", "b"]
li = []

# Add 1 element to the end with append
li.append(1)    # li is now [1]
li.append(2)    # li is now [1, 2]
li.append(4)    # li is now [1, 2, 4]
li.append(3)    # li is now [1, 2, 4, 3]
li.append((5, 6))  # li is now [1, 2, 4, 3, (5, 6)]

# Remove from the end with pop
li.pop()        # => (5,6) and li is now [1, 2, 4, 3]
li.pop()        # => 3 and li is now [1, 2, 4]
# Let's put it back
li.append(3)    # li is now [1, 2, 4, 3] again.

# Access a list like you would any array
li[0]   # => 1
# Look at the last element
li[-1]  # => 3

# Looking out of bounds is an IndexError
li[4]  # Raises an IndexError

# Slicing
# You can look at ranges with slice syntax.
# The start index is included, the end index is not
# (It's a closed/open range for you mathy types.)
li[1:3]   # Return list from index 1 to 3 => [2, 4]
li[2:]    # Return list starting from index 2 => [4, 3]
li[:3]    # Return list from beginning until index 3  => [1, 2, 4]
li[::2]   # Return list selecting every second entry => [1, 4]
li[::-1]  # Return list in reverse order => [3, 4, 2, 1]
# Use any combination of these to make advanced slices
# li[start:end:step]

# Make a one-layer-deep shallow copy using slices
li2 = li[:]  # => li2 = [1, 2, 4, 3] but (li2 is li) will result in false.

# Other ways to copy lists are:
li2 = list(li)  # This tends to be the best option, since it will work almost
                # always regardless of li's type
li2 = li.copy() # Only works if li is a list

# CAREFUL: if a list contains mutable objects, modifying them in li2 would
# still change them in li, even though they are different lists. For example:
li1 = [[1,2], [3,4]]
li2 = li1[:] # list(li1) or li1.copy() would also work

li2 is li1 # False
li2 == li1 # True
li2[0] is li1[0] # True

# Remove arbitrary elements by index from a list with "del"
del li[2]  # li is now [1, 2, 3]

# Remove first occurrence of a value
li.remove(2)  # li is now [1, 3]
li.remove(2)  # Raises a ValueError as 2 is not in the list

# Insert an element at a specific index
li.insert(1, 2)  # li is now [1, 2, 3] again

# Get the index of the first item found matching the argument
li.index(2)  # => 1
li.index(4)  # Raises a ValueError as 4 is not in the list

# You can add lists
# Note: values for li and for other_li are not modified.
li + other_li  # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Concatenate lists with "extend()"
li.extend(other_li)  # Now li is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Check for existence in a list with "in"
1 in li  # => True

# Examine the length with "len()"
len(li)  # => 6

# Reverse and sort lists
li.reverse() # [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
li.sort() # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# reversed and sorted are used to not modify the original list, but return
# a new one
print(sorted(li)) # returns new list
print(reversed(li)) # returns new iterator, not list

# Generally, you want to use sorted() since it can work with immutable objects
# and won't mess up the original

# Choose a random element of any collection
import random
random.choice(iterable)

# Tuples are like lists but are immutable.
tup = (1, 2, 3)
tup[0]      # => 1
tup[0] = 3  # Raises a TypeError

# Note that a tuple of length one has to have a comma after the last element but
# tuples of other lengths, even zero, do not.
type((1))   # => <class 'int'>
type((1,))  # => <class 'tuple'>
type(())    # => <class 'tuple'>

# You can do most of the list operations on tuples too
len(tup)         # => 3
tup + (4, 5, 6)  # => (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
tup[:2]          # => (1, 2)
2 in tup         # => True

# You can unpack tuples (or lists) into variables
a, b, c = (1, 2, 3)  # a is now 1, b is now 2 and c is now 3
# You can also do extended unpacking
a, *b, c = (1, 2, 3, 4)  # a is now 1, b is now [2, 3] and c is now 4
# Tuples are created by default if you leave out the parentheses
d, e, f = 4, 5, 6  # tuple 4, 5, 6 is unpacked into variables d, e and f
# respectively such that d = 4, e = 5 and f = 6
# Now look how easy it is to swap two values
e, d = d, e  # d is now 5 and e is now 4


# Dictionaries store mappings from keys to values
empty_dict = {}
# Here is a prefilled dictionary
filled_dict = {"one": 1, "two": 2, "three": 3}

# Note keys for dictionaries have to be immutable types. This is to ensure that
# the key can be converted to a constant hash value for quick look-ups.
# Immutable types include ints, floats, strings, tuples.
invalid_dict = {[1,2,3]: "123"}  # => Raises a TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
valid_dict = {(1,2,3):[1,2,3]}   # Values can be of any type, however.

# Look up values with []
filled_dict["one"]  # => 1

# Get all keys as an iterable with "keys()". We need to wrap the call in list()
# to turn it into a list. We'll talk about those later.  Note - for Python
# versions <3.7, dictionary key ordering is not guaranteed. Your results might
# not match the example below exactly. However, as of Python 3.7, dictionary
# items maintain the order at which they are inserted into the dictionary.
list(filled_dict.keys())  # => ["three", "two", "one"] in Python <3.7
list(filled_dict.keys())  # => ["one", "two", "three"] in Python 3.7+


# Get all values as an iterable with "values()". Once again we need to wrap it
# in list() to get it out of the iterable. Note - Same as above regarding key
# ordering.
list(filled_dict.values())  # => [3, 2, 1]  in Python <3.7
list(filled_dict.values())  # => [1, 2, 3] in Python 3.7+

# Check for existence of keys in a dictionary with "in"
"one" in filled_dict  # => True
1 in filled_dict      # => False

# Looking up a non-existing key is a KeyError
filled_dict["four"]  # KeyError

# Use "get()" method to avoid the KeyError
filled_dict.get("one")      # => 1
filled_dict.get("four")     # => None
# The get method supports a default argument when the value is missing
filled_dict.get("one", 4)   # => 1
filled_dict.get("four", 4)  # => 4

# "setdefault()" inserts into a dictionary only if the given key isn't present
filled_dict.setdefault("five", 5)  # filled_dict["five"] is set to 5
filled_dict.setdefault("five", 6)  # filled_dict["five"] is still 5

# Adding to a dictionary (updates value if key already existed)
filled_dict.update({"four":4})  # => {"one": 1, "two": 2, "three": 3, "four": 4}
filled_dict["four"] = 4         # another way to add to dict

# Remove keys from a dictionary with del
del filled_dict["one"]  # Removes the key "one" from filled dict

# From Python 3.5 you can also use the additional unpacking options
{'a': 1, **{'b': 2}}  # => {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
{'a': 1, **{'a': 2}}  # => {'a': 2}


# Sets store ... well sets
empty_set = set()
# Initialize a set with a bunch of values. Yeah, it looks a bit like a dict. Sorry.
some_set = {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4}  # some_set is now {1, 2, 3, 4}

# Similar to keys of a dictionary, elements of a set have to be immutable.
invalid_set = {[1], 1}  # => Raises a TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
valid_set = {(1,), 1}

# Add one more item to the set
filled_set = some_set
filled_set.add(5)  # filled_set is now {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
# Sets do not have duplicate elements
filled_set.add(5)  # it remains as before {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Remove one or more items with remove or discard
filled_set.remove(6) # Raises KeyError since there's no 6
filled_set.discard(6) # Is silent

# NOTE: Set operations can also be performed with functions, not shown here
# Do set intersection with &  
other_set = {3, 4, 5, 6}
filled_set & other_set  # => {3, 4, 5}

# Do set union with |

# Do set symmetric difference with ^
{1, 2, 3, 4} ^ {2, 3, 5}  # => {1, 4, 5}

# Check if set on the left is a superset of set on the right

# Check if set on the left is a subset of set on the right
{1, 2} <= {1, 2, 3} # => True

## 5. Modules and Virtual Environments
####################################################

# You can import modules
import math
print(math.sqrt(16))  # => 4.0

# You can get specific functions from a module
from math import ceil, floor
print(ceil(3.7))   # => 4.0
print(floor(3.7))  # => 3.0

# You can import all functions from a module.
# Warning: this is not recommended
from math import *

# You can shorten module names
import math as m
math.sqrt(16) == m.sqrt(16)  # => True

# And even import specific functions with aliases
from math import sqrt as alias_for_sqrt

# Python modules are just ordinary Python files. You
# can write your own, and import them. The name of the
# module is the same as the name of the file.

# You can find out which functions and attributes
# are defined in a module.
import math
dir(math)

# If you have a Python script named math.py in the same
# folder as your current script, the file math.py will
# be loaded instead of the built-in Python module.
# This happens because the local folder has priority
# over Python's built-in libraries.

# NOTE: Virtual environments are incredibly useful and highly recommended
# to keep your projects' dependencies unrelated to each other, thus avoiding
# potential conflicts. To set them up, use the 'venv' tool included in Python
# or virtualenv installed through pip. We'll use venv.

# On Windows (either PowerShell or cmd work):
# Ensure pip is up-to-date (comes with Python >=3.4):
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
# Then move to the desired folder and create the virtual env.
cd path/to/your/directory
python -m venv <MyEnv>

# And activate the environment
<MyEnv>\Scripts\activate.bat # on cmd
<MyEnv>\Scripts\Activate.ps1 # on PowerShell
        # NOTE: you might get an error on PS. Fix it by running
        # Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# This should now put you inside the virtual environment
# Again, ensure pip is up to date and start installing modules!
python -m pip install -U pip # 'python -m easy_install pip' if it doesn't work

pip install modulename

# And exit the virtual environment when done
deactivate

## 5.1 Pandas
####################################################
# Pandas is a module made for data analysis and manipulation. It offers
# data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

# https://pandas.pydata.org/

# Pandas works with DataFrames, comprised of rows and columns
# and Series, successions of values (equivalent to 1 column)

# Commonly imported with
import pandas as pd
# Changing and resetting options
pd.options.display.max_rows = 30
pd.reset_option("max_rows")

my_series = pd.Series([1,2,3])
# DFs can be created from dictionaries
my_df = pd.DataFrame({
    "Column1": ["Row1", "Row2", "Row3", "Row4"],
    "Column2": my_series
}) #Row4 will have NA/NaN value since my_series only has 3 values

# Read from/Write to csv
df = pd.read_csv("/somedirectory/csv")
df.to_csv("name of the csv file.csv")

# Read from/Write to Excel
df2 = pd.read_excel("/somedirectory/excel")
df2.to_xlsx("name of the excel file.xlsx")

# Adding new columns
my_df['Column3'] = [some_value, some_other_value]

# Simple way to write a new column derived from others
my_df["Column7"] = [int(row[1]["Column1"] and row[1]["Column2"]) for row in my_df.iterrows()]

# describe() is useful to get a quick glance at the data
# it will provide several metrics (count, mean, std, min, max...)
df.describe()

# Change the indexes for the rows with index()
df.index = ["ROW1", "ROW2"]

df.head()  # First 5 rows of data
df.head(n) # First n rows of data

# hist() can be used to get a histogram of a specific column or Series
df.hist('Column1')

# scatter() can be used to get a scatter diagram of 2 given columns or Series
df.plot.scatter('Column1', 'Column2')

# Locating data in a DataFrame
# https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html
# Use single or double brackets to obtain Series or DataFrames
df['Column3']       # Column as a Series
df[['Column3']]     # Column as a DataFrame
df[["Column1", "Column4"]] # New Dataframe out of specific columns

df['Column2'][1]    # 2nd element of Column2
df[0:2]             # DataFrame from the first 2 columns of df
# Remember that 0:2 will have 2 columns. It is a closed-open range
# In mathematical terms: [0,2) = [0,1]
sliced_df = df[0:3, 1:10]   # Grabs the first 3 columns, 2nd to 10th rows

# loc is used to locate data with row indexes and column headers
df.loc[0, "Column1"]  # => Row1, with only Column1's value
df.loc[0, "NotAColumn"]  # => KeyError
df.loc[0] # => Row1 entirely

# iloc does the same but using only integers
df.iloc[0, 0]  # => Row1
df.iloc[0, 4000]  # IndexError
df.iloc[:, 0:4] # All rows, only the first 3 columns

# Unique finds each individual value
df["Column2"].unique()  # => 1,2,3

#Filtering by value can also be done
df["Column2"] >= 2  # => 2, 3
df1 = df[df["Column2"] >= 2]
df1 = df[df.column2.isin([1, 4])] # Multiple explicit values for one column
df1 = df[(df["Column2"] == 1) & (df["Column3"] == "some string")] # Multiple-column filtering

# Operating with values
# Operations can be done to columns/Series, so they are applied to each value
df["Column2"] * 5 # => [5, 10, 15]

# Drop specific columns
df_1 = df.copy()
df_1 = df_1.drop(df_1.columns[-9:-5], axis=1)

# apply() is a strong tool which accepts lambda functions
df["Column2"].apply(lambda val: val > 2) # => [3]

# Hadamard product (matrices of same dimensions)
z = v*y  # => [0,2]

# Dot product (a measure of how similar 2 vectors are)
z = np.dot(u, v)  # => 1*0 + 0*1 = 0

array.mean()  # => 2
array.max()

np.linspace(-2, 2, num=9)  # => [-2, -1.5, -1, -0.5. 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2]

array.size  # => 9 (3x3)
b = np.array([[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1]])
b.shape # => (2,3)
b.size  # => 6

# And as with 1-D arrays, they can be operated upon, just like matrices
# The only particular operation is matrix multiplication
x = np.array([[0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1]])
y = np.array([[1, 1], [1, 1], [-1, 1]])

## 6.1 Inheritance

# Inheritance allows new child classes to be defined that inherit methods and
# variables from their parent class.

# Using the Human class defined above as the base or parent class, we can
# define a child class, Superhero, which inherits the class variables like
# "species", "name", and "age", as well as methods, like "sing" and "grunt"
# from the Human class, but can also have its own unique properties.

# To take advantage of modularization by file you could place the classes above in their own files,
# say, human.py

# To import functions from other files use the following format
# from "filename-without-extension" import "function-or-class"

    # its arguments, but can also define additional arguments or definitions

# Files in Python can be read or written to, as well as updated, supporting
# either binary or encoded text files. By default, files are open to read text
# The best syntax is the following:
with open("filename", "mode", "encoding") as f:
    # Operate with the file, it'll be closed once done
    f.read()

# But you can also use the old way
f  = open("filename", "mode", "encoding")
# Remember to close files once done if you chose this
f.close()
"""
Modes can be:
    r - Read (default)
    w - Write. Overwrites if already exists, creates if not
    a - Append. Creates if non-existant
    x - Exclusive creation. If the file already exists, it fails
    + - Update (read & write)
    
    t - Text mode (default)
    b - Binary mode (using bytes objects)

These 2 blocks can actually be combined, e.g. "r+b", "a", "xb", "+"
"""

with open("filename", "mode", "encoding") as f:    
# Files can be read with read() or written to with write()
    f.read(5) # Reads 5 characters, and moves the reader pointer
    f.readline() # A more elegant way to read entire lines individually
    f.readlines() # Returns a list with every line in the file
    f.write("This is a string") # Writes with the specified encoding
    f.writelines(["This is a\n", "list of strings"]) # Writes without newlines
            # unless added in by hand

# To relocate the pointer to a specific position, use seek()
    f.seek(0) # Returns to first character

# Generators help you make lazy code. Generators must have at least 1 "yield"
# and can have return statements too. They create single-use generator objects
# which are equal to iterators
def double_numbers(iterable):
    for i in iterable:
        yield i + i

# Generators are memory-efficient because they only load the data needed to
# process the next value in the iterable. This allows them to perform
# operations on otherwise prohibitively large value ranges. This is called
# "lazy" loading
# NOTE: `range` replaces `xrange` in Python 3.
for i in double_numbers(range(1, 900000000)):  # `range` is a generator.
    print(i)
    if i >= 30:
        break

# Just as you can create a list comprehension, you can create generator
# comprehensions as well using parentheses.
values = (-x for x in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
for x in values:
    print(x)  # prints -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 to console/terminal

# You can also cast a generator comprehension directly to a list.
values = (-x for x in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
gen_to_list = list(values)
print(gen_to_list)  # => [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]


# The zip() function takes 0 or more iterables, aggregates them in a tuple,
# element by element (first element from all iterables, then second,
# etc), and returns an iterator of said tuples
number_list = [1, 2, 3]
str_list = ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four']
# 'four' will never have a pair, since number_list only goes up to 3

print(list(zip())) # => []
zip_result = zip(number_list, str_list)
print(set(zip_result)) # => {(2, 'two'), (1, 'one'), (3, 'three')} (order is random)
print(list(zip_result)) # => [(1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (3, 'three')]

# zip can also be used to unzip collections into tuples
numbers, names = zip(list(zip_result))
numbers # => (1, 2, 3)
names # => ('one', 'two', 'three')

# Cartesian product using itertools:
import itertools

somelists = [[1, 2, 3],['a', 'b'],[4, 5]]
list(itertools.product(*somelists))


# Decorators
# In this example `beg` wraps `say`. If say_please is True then it
# will change the returned message.
from functools import wraps

def beg(target_function):
    @wraps(target_function)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        msg, say_please = target_function(*args, **kwargs)
        if say_please:
            return "{} {}".format(msg, "Please! I am poor :(")
        return msg

    return wrapper


@beg
def say(say_please=False):
    return "Can you buy me a beer?", say_please


print(say())                 # Can you buy me a beer?
print(say(say_please=True))  # Can you buy me a beer? Please! I am poor :(

## 9. Testing
####################################################
# Automated tests are a fantastic way to ensure code works even after changes
# are pushed, and to keep things running without spending hours manually
# checking for errors in menial tasks

# Python includes the module unittest not only for Unit Tests, but many others
import unittest

# Define a class which inherits from the type of test you want
class Some_Testing_Class(unittest.TestCase):
    # You can perform set ups and tear downs per test method
    def setUp(self):
        # Create objects, open files...
        pass
    
    # And define the tests inside the class, always prefixing with "test_"
    def test_something(self):
        # Perform the test itself with the included tools, such as assertions
        self.assertEqual(some_function(), 4) # Fails if the function doesn't
                        # return 4. Other types are asertTrue, asertRaises...
        pass
        
    def tearDown(self):
        # Delete objects, close files...
        pass
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
    
# And all tests included in the class will be run when the file containing
# this class is run

## 10. APIs
####################################################
# APIs allow different programs or code written in other languages
# to communicate with yours through sets of methods, or interfaces.
# REST APIs (REpresentational State Transfer) work over internet
# protocols, usually HTTP with JSON messages, though it may vary.
